With AI-driven productivity on the rise, developer job openings in North America have decreased by nearly 35% over the past five years, making hiring more competitive than ever.

If North American job postings feel unfamiliar, this course guides you through how to read them effectively. Using real English resumes from Pacemaker developers hired by Canadian companies, you’ll learn how to analyze job postings and reflect those insights directly in your resume.`;
